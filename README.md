# 100DaysOfCode
This will be a journal of my progress in completing the #100daysofcode challenge

This is the first time I am participating in this challenge starting on July 16th 2022, the 100th day will be October 24, 2022

My Plan is to work on a few primary goals and then if I have time or feel like getting to them sooner start on some of my other ideas.
To complete this challenge I'll be coding for at least an hour every day from today, July 16th 2022 to October 24, 2022.
I Plan to keep a log of my progress in this github repository to document what I accomplish and learn during this time.
