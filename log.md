# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 16, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Completed Overhaul of Mocside Grade Grid

**Thoughts:** Initially I was attempting to color the problems on page load, but they aren't loaded until expanded, which ultimately meant they were getting no colors. After realizing this I redesigned how and when I colored the problems so that both the labs and the problems of each lab are accurately colored. This took me longer than I thought it should.

**What I Accomplished Today**: 
  * Fixed the sorting of Mocside Coruses, Labs, & Grades
  * Fixed the percent complete and most recent activity for Labs in Mocside
  * Re-enabled the coloring of the labs and problems table rows for complete and incomplete problems
  * Completed the Grade Grid overhaul


### Day 2: July 17, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Started Work overhauling the Course Edit Page

**Thoughts:** CSS is not my strong suite and it shows, this particular overhaul is very css and style heavy. I can handle it no problem but it doesn't come as naturally or as quickly as writing code that performs functions and such.

**What I Accomplished Today**:
 * Began overhaul of Course Edit
 * Moved Key-generation to its own component
 * Fixed the keygen functions after migrating them
 * Split key create and the list of keys into two side by side sections
 * Converted list of keys into a table format and replace the links to copy and delete with font awesome icons

### Day 3: July 18, 2022
** Today's Progress: Completed the Key-generation styling and Functionality

**Thoughts:** Finished the keygen section, both the styling and the functionality.
              It looks way better than it did, and I'm super happy with it.

**What I Accomplished Today**:
 * Filtered the date in the keygen table so only m/d/y is shown
 * Moved around the key generation methods and inputs
 * made labels smaller to increase focus to the inputs
 * Moved Expire Date and Expire Time to be one line
 * Moved the generation button over
