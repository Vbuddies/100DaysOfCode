# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 16, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Completed Overhaul of Mocside Grade Grid

**Thoughts:** Initially I was attempting to color the problems on page load, but they aren't loaded until expanded, which ultimately meant they were getting no colors. After realizing this I redesigned how and when I colored the problems so that both the labs and the problems of each lab are accurately colored. This took me longer than I thought it should.

**What I Accomplished Today**: 
  * Fixed the sorting of Mocside Coruses, Labs, & Grades
  * Fixed the percent complete and most recent activity for Labs in Mocside
  * Re-enabled the coloring of the labs and problems table rows for complete and incomplete problems
  * Completed the Grade Grid overhaul
